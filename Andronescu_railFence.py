"""
Another Mediocre Creation by Christina Andronescu
this program will take a message of your choice and encrypt it or decrypt it. For
encryption, in layman terms, this program takes all the even-numbered letters and
odd-numbered letters and places the even ones at the front and the odd ones at the
the end of a resulting, printed string. Decryption is the reverse of that with
consideration of the message's length (number of characters).
