                        This is a completely asinine idea for a foundation—or rather a website—thought up by an overworked student who has had the creativity forcibly wrung out them by the public school system to the point where this—what you are unfortunately subjecting your eyes to at this very second—is their feeble last-ditch attempt at humor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please pretend that these words are in fact not a desperate attempt to salvage a grade, but rather a clever extended play-on-words that demands the liberation of the common houseplant.
